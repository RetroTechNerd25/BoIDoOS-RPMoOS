Bits of Information Distributed on Operating Systems/Random Programs Made on Operating Systems... although, that's more of a title that just stuck. Each piece of tech will have 5 programs plus an audio file.
The former will all be related to the Chansu o Tsukama series. The latter will be the piece of tech's "theme", in a way. In other words, most of the software here will be related to the CoT series.
Since I will not be replicating their masterpieces, I would like to thank Charles Babbage (Difference Engine and Analytical Engine), Ada Lovelace (Note G for the Analytical Engine), 
William Cooke, Charles Wheatstone (Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph), and Samuel Morse (Morse Code).
