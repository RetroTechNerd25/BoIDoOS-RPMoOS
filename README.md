Bits of Information Distributed on Operating Systems/Random Programs Made on Operating Systems... although, that's more of a title that just stuck. Each piece of tech will have 5 programs plus an audio file.
I would like to thank Charles Babbage (Difference Engine and Analytical Engine), Ada Lovelace (widely recognized as the first computer programmer), William Cooke, Charles Wheatstone
(Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph), and Samuel Morse (Morse Code).
